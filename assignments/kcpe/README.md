#KCPE
This is a simple example for managing KCPE marks. 
We will build it from a very crude form and keep refining it
incrementally.

#Part 1
* Create a folder called `kcpe` where will keep all our files.
* Write a simple program that will take in marks for the file subjects (for one student): Maths, English, Kiswahili, Science, Social Studies &mdash; in that order

#Part 2
* Find the total marks scored by a particular students

#Part 3
* Find the average mark scored by the student

#Part 4
* Given the average mark (in 3 above), find the mean-grade: *>=70 (A), >=60(B), >=50 (C), >=40(D), <40(E)

#Part 5
* To persist the everything we have in our variables, store all this in a **Python Pickle** &mdash; read about *pickling*
