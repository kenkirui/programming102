For each for the following instructions, write the equivalent command to be typed on the terminal:

* **Change directory** to the home directory
* Create a file called hello.txt and with the content `hello Bash!`
* Create a directory named `hello` in the `home` directory
* Copy the `hello.txt` file created above to the `hello` folder
* Delete the original `hello.txt` file, the one at home i.e. `~/hello.txt`

> *Note: * Do all the above commands without changing directory (cd) from `home` (~), hence all the questions above should have only one command as the answer.
